# LogicSymbolsThyperHelper

## Description 

As the name says! 

I had to type text using logic symbols, such as 
  ∨ ∧ ¬  →   ⊦  ⊨

This is the crude solution I choose: to program a memo field, using Lazarus, with a button-activated-replacement procedure. For instance, * stands for ∧. Later, I transfer the result to a word processor. <sub>*(A keyboard hook with instant-replacement would be prettier, but it's platform-dependent, oh, spare me)*</sub>

Some alternatives are:
- learn Latex and its commands, like \rightarrow;
- use an equation editor in word processors like Microsoft Word;
- program shortcuts, again in a word processor;
- use KLatexFormula, and paste images in your text;
- use Lyx;
- paper - pen - photograph;
- forget the whole thing.

## Compiling

Download, open the project in Lazarus, compile.

Free code, no guarantees of correct or incorrect functioning ⊦ a pretty logical statement (bazinga).

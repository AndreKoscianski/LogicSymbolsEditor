# LogicSymbolsEditor

## Description 

A simple story for which I sought a simple answer.

I began preparing a course on logic for computer science.

Besides taking notes and planning the lessons, I also needed to create lists of exercises. 
The course deals with deductions and propositional logic, and there the trouble begins. 
This branch of mathematics uses a number of symbols that are not usual: 

  ∨ ∧ ¬  →  ↔  ⊦  ⊨

There is Latex, but Holy Cow, the year is 2022 and normal people uses WYSIWYG.
Then we have tools as KLatex to create formula, but generating images and inserting in a word processor is cumbersome.
Lyx is not bad, but we're still too far from .docx. As I said, WYSIWYG.

I resort to programming string-replacement in a Lazarus Memo. That's roughly 15 minutes of programming.

I'm using Linux; if I had Windoes+Office+macros, maybe I could've done it differently...

## Compiling

Download de files, open the project in Lazarus, compile.
